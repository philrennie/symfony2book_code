# About this repository
This repository will hold the example code for the book I have started to write about the Symfony 2 framework.
 
# About the Book
A guide to Symfony 2 is intended to be the tutorial and reference that I would have liked to have found when I began my first project using the framework.

You can find the Leanpub.com page for the book [here](http://leanpub.com/philrenniesymfony2)

You can find the repository for the manuscript of the free portion of the book on github [here](https://github.com/jentulman/symfony2book)
